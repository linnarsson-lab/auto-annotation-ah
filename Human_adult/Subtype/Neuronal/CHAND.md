- UNC5B, RORA, TRPS1, and NFIB from Bakken et. al 2021 motor cortex paper
Note that these genes are also expressed in LAMP5-LHX6 cells.

- Added FOXG1 to limit this annotation to the telencephalon, and GAD1 to limit to GABAergic cells. ChC cells in our data did not express GAD2.

- Add CA8 based on the human data

- Removed PVALB, some chandelier cells in our human data are PVALB negative
