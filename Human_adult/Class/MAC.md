    Non-microglial macrophages and monocytes uniquely expressed the genes coagulation factor XIII, A1 subunit (F13a1, macrophage), histocompatibility 2, class II antigen A, alpha (H2-Aa, macrophage), chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (Ccr2, monocyte), lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (Lyve1, macrophage), and macrophage galactose N-acetyl-galactosamine specific lectin 2 (Mgl2, macrophage), genes that were barely expressed, if at all, by microglia
