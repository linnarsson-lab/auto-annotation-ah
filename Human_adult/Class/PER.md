    "For example, the absence of α‐smooth muscle actin (SMA) on NG2‐positive cells in CNS capillaries has led some workers to the erroneous conclusion that NG2 is expressed by endothelial cells, rather than mural cells, in this microvasculature (Schrappe et al., 1991; Grako and Stallcup, 1995). Our current results demonstrate that, although SMA is an excellent marker for smooth muscle cells, it is not always an appropriate marker for pericytes in vivo."
