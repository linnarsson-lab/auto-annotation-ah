synonyms:
- Serotonergic neurotransmission
---

Cells possessing serotonergic presynaptic terminals. 

Justification:

* Expresses Fev, key transcription factor for making serotonergic neurons [1]
* Expresses Tph2, the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin

DDC is also necessary for serotonin synthesis. Including DDC because some neurons in our data express TPH2 and FEV without DDC.
